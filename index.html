            <p>
                The Blu-Ray&trade; format is the future for owning hard copies of your favorite films. It is <strong>the</strong> 
                media format, letting you watch your favorite movies in 720p or 1080p. Blu-Ray disks can also store more than a normal DVD.

            <h3>How do you use Blu-Ray&trade; disks?</h3>
            <p>
                Blu-Ray&trade; disks must be played on a device that can handle the format. Include
                but are not limited to: video game consoles, Blu-Ray&trade; disk players (<em><a href="html/products.html#navigation">Purchase your own here</a></em>)
                Regular Blu-Rays&trade; work differently than regular DVDs and require a different player. Blu-Rays&trade; are also region locked in the same way that 
                DVDs are region locked. The disk must be a part of the same region as the player.
